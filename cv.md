3. **Summary.**

I think the goal should be one. Because of this, you are more focused on it. 
My goal is to start a career as a frontend developer at EPAM and develop my skills. In the shortest time to grow to TeamLead.

4. **Skills.**

I have been studying programming for over two years. During this time, I learned to operate, at a good level, in a language like C ++. I also have experience with SQL, Photoshop, HTML / CSS / JS, PHP.

5. **Experience**

Applied his skills only to solve the problems of the university.

6. **Education.**

I am studying at the Belarusian State University of Economics (BSEU). Department of Applied Mathematics and Cybernetics. The second course of full-time training in the economics of cybernetics. 
I also took part in the selection for ITransition courses on frontend development, but after offensive criticism towards EPAM, I stopped trying to get there. 
I had the pleasure to attend a seminar from Business Youth, I learned more about these information giants and became convinced of the illiteracy of these “businessmen”. Pass the course tester.

7. **English level**

11 years of schooling and a year of specialized English in high school. Now I independently study and practice English with a carrier.
